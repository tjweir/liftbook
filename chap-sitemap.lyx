\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SiteMap is a very powerful part of Lift that does essentially what it says:
 provides a map (menu) for your site.
 Of course, if all it did was generate a set of links on your page, we wouldn't
 have a whole chapter dedicated to it.
 SiteMap not only handles the basic menu generation functionality, but also
 provides:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Access control mechanisms that deal not only with whether a menu item is
 visible, but also whether the page it points to is accessible
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Grouping of menu items so that you can easily display portions of menus
 where you want them
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Nested menus so you can have hierarchies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Request rewriting (similar to Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:URL-Rewriting"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
State-dependent computations for such things as page titles, page-specific
 snippets, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beauty of SiteMap is that it's very easy to start out with the basic
 functionality and then expand on it as you grow.

Let's start with our basic menu for PocketChange
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Revise this as needed to match reality, and verify all code in this chapter
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 To keep things simple, we'll just define four menu items to begin:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A home page that displays the user's entries when the user is logged in,
 or a welcome page when the user is not
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A logout link when the user is logged in, log in and registration links
 and pages when the user is not
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Pages to view or edit the user's profile, available only when the user is
 logged in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A help page, available whether the user is logged in or not
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll assume that we have the corresponding pages, "
\family typewriter
homepage
\family default
", "
\family typewriter
login
\family default
", "
\family typewriter
logout
\family default
", and "
\family typewriter
profile
\family default
," written and functional.
 We'll also assume that the help page(s) reside under the "
\family typewriter
help
\family default
" subdirectory to keep things neat, and that the entry to help is 
\family typewriter
/help/index
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Link Class

\begin_layout Standard
The Link class
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\family typewriter
net.liftweb.sitemap.Loc.Link
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is a fundamental part of Menu definitions.
 The 
\family typewriter
Link 
\family default
class contains two parameters: a 
\family typewriter
List[String]
\family default
 of path components, and a boolean value that controls whether prefix matching
 is enabled.
 The path components represent the portion of the URI following your web
 context, split on the "/" character.
 Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Link-Path-Components"

\end_inset

 shows how you would use Link to represent the "/utils/index" page.
 Of course, instead of 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

utils
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 :: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

index
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 :: Nil
\family default
, you could as easily use 
\family typewriter
List(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

utils
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

index
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\family default
 if you prefer.

Prefix matching allows the path components you specify to match any longer
 paths as well.
 Following our first example, if you wanted to match anything under the
 utils directory (say, for access control), you would set the second parameter
 to 
\family typewriter

The ExtLink object can be used to create a Link instance using your own
 full link URL.
 As its name implies, it would usually be used for an external location.

\begin_layout Standard
Menu entries are created using the Menu

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\family typewriter

\end_layout

\end_inset

 class, and its corresponding Menu object.
 A Menu, in turn, holds a Loc
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\family typewriter
net.liftweb.sitemap.Loc
\end_layout

\end_inset

 trait instance, which is where most of the interesting things happen.
 A menu can also hold one or more child menus, which we'll cover in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Nested-Menus"

\end_inset

.
 Note that the Loc object has several implicit methods that make defining
 Locs easier, so you generally want to import them into scope 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
How to best emphasize this (and other notes)?
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The simplest way is to import 
\family typewriter
net.liftweb.sitemap.Loc._
\family default
, but you can import specific methods by name if you prefer.
 A Loc can essentially be thought of as a link in the menu, and contains
 four basic items:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The name of the Loc: this must be unique across your sitemap because it
 can be used to look up specific Menu items if you customize your menu display
 (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Using-lift-Menu"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The link to which the Loc refers: usually this will referernce a specific
 page, but Lift allows a single Loc to match based on prefix as well (Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:The-Link-Class"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The text of the menu item, which will be displayed to the user: you can
 use a static string or you can generate it with a function (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:menu-LinkText"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
An optional set of LocParam parameters that control the behavior and appearance
 of the menu item (see Sections 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Customizing-Display"

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Access-Control"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Misc-Menu"

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Page-Specific-Rendering"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For our example, we'll tackle the help page link first, because it's the
 simplest (essentially, it's a static link).
 The definition is shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Help-Menu-Definition"

\end_inset

.
 We're assuming that you've imported the Loc implicit methods to keep things
 simple.
 We'll cover instantiating the classes directly in later sections of this
 chapter.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

                        "Help"))
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we've named the menu item "helpHome." We can use this name to refer
 back to this menu item elsewhere in our code.
 The second parameter is a 
\family typewriter
Pair[List[String],Boolean]
\family default
 which converts directly to a Link class with the given parameters (see
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:The-Link-Class"

\end_inset

 above).
 In this instance, by passing in true, we're saying that anything under
 the help directory will also match.
 If you just use a List[String], the implicit conversion is to a Link with
 prefix matching disabled.
 Note that SiteMap won't allow access to any pages that don't match any
 Menu entries
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
emphasize
\end_layout

\end_inset

, so by doing this we're allowing full access to all of the help files without
 having to specify a menu entry for each.
 The final parameter, "Help," is the text for the menu link, should we choose
 to generate a menu link from this SiteMap entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Nested Menus
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Nested-Menus"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Menu class supports child menus by passing them in as final constructor
 parameters.
 For instance, if we wanted to have an "about" menu under Help, we could
 define the menu as shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Nested-Menu-Definition"

\end_inset

.

val aboutMenu = Menu(Loc("about", "help" :: "about" :: Nil, "About"))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

val helpMenu = Menu(Loc(...as defined above...), aboutMenu)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the menu is rendered it will have a child menu for About.
 Child menus are only rendered by default when the current page matches
 their parent's Loc.
 That means that, for instance the following links would show in an "About"
 child menu item:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/help/index
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/help/usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the following would not:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/index
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/site/example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll cover how you can customize the rendering of the menus in Section

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Setting the Global SiteMap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have all of your menu items defined, you need to set them as your
 SiteMap.
 As usual, we do this in the Boot class by calling the 
\family typewriter
setSiteMap
\family default
 method on LiftRules, as shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Setting-the-SiteMap"

\end_inset

.
 The 
\family typewriter
setSiteMap
\family default
 method takes a SiteMap object that can be constructed using your menu items
 as arguments.

There are many cases where you may want to change the way that particular

 For instance, if you're using a Menu item for access control on a subdirectory,
 you may not want the menu item displayed at all.
 We'll discuss how you can control appearance, text, etc.
 in this section.

The Hidden LocParam does exactly what it says: hides the menu item from
 the menu display.
 All other menu features still work.
 There is a variety of reasons why you might not want a link displayed.
 A common use, shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Hidden-Menus"

\end_inset

, is where the point of the item is to restrict access to a particular subdirect
ory based on some condition.
 (We'll cover the

\begin_layout Standard
Note that in this example we've used the implicit conversion from 
\family typewriter
Pair[String,Boolean]

 to 
\family typewriter

\family default
 to make this Menu apply to everything under the "
\family typewriter
receipts

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Controlling the Menu Text
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:menu-LinkText"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
LinkText
\family default
 class is what defines the function that will return the text to display
 for a given menu item.
 As we've shown, this can easily be set using the implicit conversion for
 string
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset


\family typewriter
LinkText
\family default
 from 
\family typewriter
Loc
\family default
.
 As an added bonus, the implicit conversion actually takes a by-name 
\family typewriter
String
\family default
 for the parameter.
 This means that you can just as easily pass in a function to generate the
 link text as a static string.
 For example, with our profile link we may want to make the link say "<username>
's profile".
 Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Customizing-Link-Text"

\end_inset

 shows how we can do this by defining a helper method, assuming that there's
 another method that will return the current user's name (we use the ubiquitous
 
\family typewriter
Foo
\family default
 object here).

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, if you want you can construct the 
\family typewriter
LinkText
\family default
 instance directly by passing in a constructor function that returns a 
\family typewriter
NodeSeq
\family default
.
 The function that you use with 
\family typewriter
LinkText
\family default
 takes a type-safe input parameter, which we'll discuss in more detail in
 Section

So far we've covered the Scala side of things.
 The other half of the magic is the special 
\family typewriter
<lift:Menu>
\family default
 tag.
 It's this tag that handles the rendering of your menus into XHTML.
 The Menu tag uses a built-in snippet
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
net.liftweb.builtin.snippet.Menu
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to provide several rendering methods.
 The most commonly used method is the 
\family typewriter
Menu.builder
\family default
 snippet.
 This snippet renders your entire menu structure as an unordered list (
\family typewriter
<ul>
\family default
 in XHTML).
 Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Rendering-with-Menu.title"

\end_inset

 shows an example of using the Menu tag to build the default menu (yes,
 it's that easy).

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, Lift offers more customization on this snippet than just emitting
 some XHTML.
 By specifying some prefixed attributes on the tag itself, you can add attribute
s directly to the menu elements.
 The following prefixes are valid for attributes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ul
\family default
 - Adds the specified attribute to the 
\family typewriter
<ul>
\family default
 element that makes up the menu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
li
\family default
 - Adds the specified attribute to each 
\family typewriter
<li>
\family default
 element for the menu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
li_item
\family default
 - Adds the specified attribute to the current page's menu item
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
li_path
\family default
 - Adds the specified attribute to the current page's breadcrumb trail (the
 breadcrumb trail is the set of menu items that are direct ancestors in
 the menu tree)
\begin_inset Note Note

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The suffix of the attributes represents the name of the HTML attribute that
 will be added to that element, and can be anything.
 It will be passed directly through.
 For instance, we can add CSS
\begin_inset Index

 classes to our menu and elements fairly easily, as shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 the name parameter of the Loc for the menu (the first parameter).
 If you write your own Loc implementation (Section

The next snippet in the Menu class is 
\family typewriter
item
\family default
.
 The 
\family typewriter
Menu.item
\family default
 snippet allows you to render a particular menu item by specifying the name
 attribute (matching the first parameter to Loc).
 As with 
\family typewriter
Menu.builder
\family default
, it allows you to specify additional prefixed attributes for the link to
 be passed to the emitted item.
 Because it applies these attributes to the link itself, the only valid
 prefix is "
\family typewriter
a
\family default
".
 Additionally, if you specify child elements for the snippet tag, they will
 be used instead of the default link text.

\begin_layout Standard
So far we've covered how to control the display side of Menus; now we'll
 take a look at some of the plumbing behind the scenes.
 One important function of a Menu is that it controls access to the pages
 in your application.
 If no Menu matches a given request, then the user gets a 404 Not Found
 error.
 Other than this binary control of "matches
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

display" and "doesn't match
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

don't display", 
\family typewriter
SiteMap
\family default
 provides for arbitrary access checks through the 
\family typewriter

\family default

 takes a test function, 
\begin_inset Formula $()\Rightarrow Boolean$
\end_inset

, as well as failure message function, 
\begin_inset Formula $()\Rightarrow LiftResponse$
\end_inset

, as its arguments.
 When the 
\family typewriter
Loc
\family default
 that uses the 
\family typewriter
If
\family default
 clause matches a given path, the test function is executed, and if true
 then the page is displayed as normal.
 If the function evaluates to false, then the failure message function is
 executed and its result is sent to the user.
 There's an implicit conversion in 
\family typewriter
Loc
\family default
 from a 
\family typewriter
String
\family default
 to a response which converts to a 
\family typewriter

 The redirect is to the location specified by

, which is the root of your webapp ("/") by default.
 If you want, you can change this in

 The exact same rules apply, except that the page is displayed only if the

 it's generally clearer when a predicate is read as "working" when it returns
 true.

The Template Parameter
\begin_inset CommandInset label

Generally, the template that will be used for a page is derived from the
 path of the request.
 The

Template
\family default
 
\family typewriter
LocParam
\family default
, however, allows you to completely override this mechanism and provide
 any template you want by passing in a function 
\begin_inset Formula $()\Rightarrow NodeSeq$
\end_inset

.
 Going back to our example menus (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Basic-SiteMap-Definition"

\end_inset

), we'd like the welcome page to show either the user's entries or a plain
 welcome screen depending on whether they're logged in.
 One approach to this is shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Override-Templates"

\end_inset

.
 In this example, we create a 
\family typewriter
Template
\family default
 class that generates the appropriate template and then bind it into the
 home page menu 
\family typewriter
Loc
\family default
.
 (See the Lift API for more on the Template class.)

\begin_layout Subsection
The Snippet and LocSnippets Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides overriding the template for a page render (admittedly, a rather
 coarse approach), SiteMap has two mechanisms for overriding or defining
 the behavior of specific snippets.
 The first, Snippet, allows you to define the dispatch for a single snippet
 based on the name of the snippet.
 Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Using-the-Snippet-locparam"

\end_inset

 shows how we could use Snippet to achieve the same result for the home
 page rendering as we just did with the Template parameter.
 All we need to do is use the <lift:homepage> snippet on our main page and
 the snippet mapping will dispatch based on the state.
 (Here we've moved the welcome text into a Utils.welcome snippet.)

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LocSnippets trait extends the concept of Snippet to provide a full dispatch
 partial function.
 This allows you to define multiple snippet mappings associated with a particula
r Loc.
 To simplify things, Lift provides a DispatchLocSnippets trait that has
 default implementations for 
\family typewriter
apply
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
isDefinedAt
\family default
; that means you only need to provide a 
\family typewriter
dispatch
\family default
 method implementation for it to work.

As we mentioned in Section

Test is intended to be used to ensure that a given request has the proper

 With Test, you provide a function,

 that is passed the full Req object.
 Note that the test is performed when SiteMap tries to locate the correct
 menu, as opposed to If and Unless, which are tested after the proper Loc
 has been identified.
 Returning a false means that this Loc doesn't match the request, so SiteMap
 will continue to search through your Menus to find an appropriate Loc.
 As an example, we could check to make sure that a given request comes from
 Opera (the Req object provides convenience methods to test for different
 browsers; see the Lift API for a full list) with the code in Listing

\begin_layout Standard
As we've shown, there's a lot of functionality available for your Menu items.
 If you need more control, though, the Loc trait offers some functionality,
 such as rewriting, that doesn't have a direct correspondence in a LocParam
 element.
 The basic definition of a Loc implementation covers a lot of the same things.
 The following vals and defs are abstract, so you must implement them yourself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
def name: the name that can be used to retrieve the menu via Menu.item
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
def link: the actual link; you can use the implicit conversions from List[String
] or Pair[List[String],Boolean], or you can create the Link object yourself
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
def text: the text that will be displayed to the user; you can use the implicit
 conversion from String, or you can provide your own LinkText instance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
def params: must return a List[LocParam] that is used to control behavior
 as we've shown in the previous sections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
def defaultParams: used for type-safe rewriting, which we'll cover in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Type-Safe-Params"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Essentially, these mirror the params that are required when you use Loc.apply
 to generate a Loc.
 We're going to write our own Loc implementation for our Expenses in this
 section to demonstrate how this works.
 Because this overlaps with existing functionality in the PocketChange applicati
on, we'll be using a branch in the PocketChange app.
 You can pull the new branch with the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
git checkout --track -b custom-loc origin/custom-loc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can then switch back and forth between the branches with the commands:

\begin_layout Standard
One of the nice features of Loc is that it allows you to rewrite requests
 in a type-safe manner.
 What this means is that we can define a rewrite function on our Loc instance
 that returns not only a standard RewriteResponse, but also a parameter
 that we can define to pass information back to our menu to control behavior.
 The reason that this is type-safe is that we define our Loc on the type
 of the parameter itself.
 For instance, let's expand the functionality of our app so that we have
 a page called "acct" that shows the expense entries for a given account.
 We would like this page to be viewable only by the owner of the account
 under normal circumstances, but to allow them to share it with other members
 if they wish to.
 Let's start by defining our type-safe parameter class as shown in Listing
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Defining-LedgerInfo"

\end_inset

.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We define a few case classes to indicate various states.
 The FullAccountInfo holds the account itself as well as some flags for
 behavior.
 Now that we have our parameter type, we can start to define our Loc, as
 shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Defining-a-Type-Safe-loc"

Assuming that an Account instance has a unique string ID, we would like

 Our rewrite function, shown in Listing

\end_inset

, handles a few different things at once.
 It handles locating the correct account and then checking the permissions
 if everything else is OK.

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we've defined the transformation from URL to parameter, we need
 to define the behaviors based on that parameter.
 The account page will show a list of expense entries only if the account
 is located and is public.
 For this example we'll use a single template and we'll change the snippet
 behavior based on our parameter, as shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Defining-Snippet-Behavior"

\end_inset

In this example, we simply return some text if the 
\family typewriter
Account
\family default
 can’t be located, isn’t public, or doesn’t have any 
\family typewriter
Expense
\family default
 entries.
 Remember that this function needs to return a snippet function, which expects
 a NodeSeq parameter.
 This is why we need to include the 
\family typewriter
ignore
\family default
 parameter as part of our closures.
 If our 
\family typewriter
Account
\family default
 does have entries, we return a real snippet method defined in our 
\family typewriter
Accounts
\family default
 object.
 In our template, we simply use an entries snippet tag, as shown in Listing

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we’ve shown in this chapter, SiteMap offers a wide range of functionality
 to let you control site navigation and access.
 You can customize the display of your individual items using the 
\family typewriter
LinkText
\family default
 
\family typewriter
LocParam
\family default
 as well as through the functionality of the built-in 
\family typewriter
Menu
\family default
 
\family typewriter
builder
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
item
\family default
 snippets.
 You can use the 
\family typewriter
If
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Unless
\family default
 
\family typewriter
LocParam
\family default
s to control access to your pages programmatically, and you can use the
 
\family typewriter
Test
\family default
 
\family typewriter
LocParam
\family default
 to check the request before it's even dispatched.
 Page-specific rendering can be customized with the 
\family typewriter
Template
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
Snippet
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
LocSnippet
\family default
 
\family typewriter
LocParam
\family default
s, and you can group menu items together via the 
\family typewriter
LocGroup
\family default
 
\family typewriter
LocParam
\family default
.
 Finally, you can consolidate all of these functions by writing your own
 
\family typewriter
Loc
\family default
 trait subclass directly, and gain the additional benefit of type-safe URL
 rewriting.
 Together these offer a rich set of tools for building your web site exactly
 they way you want to.
