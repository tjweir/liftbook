\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our experience, most webapps end up needing to store user data somewhere.
 Once you start working with user data, though, you start dealing with issues
 like coding up input forms, validation

\end_layout

\end_inset

, persistence, etc.
 to handle the data.
 That's where the Mapper and Record frameworks come in.
 These frameworks provides a scaffolding for all of your data manipulation
 needs.
 Mapper is the original Lift persistence framework, and it is closely tied
 to JDBC for its storage.
 Record is a new refactorization of Mapper that is backing-store agnostic
 at its core, so it doesn't matter whether you want to save your data to
 JDBC, JPA, or even something such as XML.
 With Record, selecting the proper driver will be as simple as hooking the
 proper traits into your class.

The Record framework is relatively new to Lift.
 
\strikeout on
The plan is to move to Record as the primary ORM framework for Lift sometime
 post-1.0.

\strikeout default
 Because Record is still under active design and development, and because
 of its current

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 status, this chapter is mostly going to focus on Mapper.
 We will, however, provide a few comparitive examples of Record functionality
 to give you a general feel for the flavor of the changes.
 In any case, Mapper will not go away even when record comes out, so you
 can feel secure that any code using Mapper will be viable for quite a while.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction to Mapper and MetaMapper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's start by discussing the relationship between the Mapper
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Mapper
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and MetaMapper
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
MetaMapper
\end_layout

\end_inset

 traits (and the corresponding Record
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Record
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and MetaRecord
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
MetaRecord
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Mapper provides the 
\emph on
per-instance
\emph default
 functionality for your class, while MetaMapper handles the 
\emph on
global
\emph default
 operations for your class and provides a common location to define per-class
 static specializations of things like field order, form generation, and
 HTML representation.
 In fact, many of the Mapper methods actually delegate to methods on MetaMapper.
 In addition to Mapper and MetaMapper, there is a third trait, MappedField,
 that provides the per-field functionality for your class.
 In Record, the trait is simply called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Field
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The MappedField trait lets you define the individual validators as well
 as filters to transform the data and the field name.
 Under Record, Field adds some functionality such as tab order and default
 error messages for form input handling.

Since Mapper is a separate module, you need to add the following dependency
 to your pom.xml to access it:

Setting Up the Database Connection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thing you need to do is to define the database connection.
 We do this by defining an object called 
\family typewriter
DBVendor
\family default
 (but you can call it whatever you want).
 This object extends the net.liftweb.mapper.ConnectionManager trait and must
 implement two methods: newConnection and releaseConnection.
 You can make this as sophisticated as you want, with pooling, caching,
 etc., but for now, Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows a basic implementation to set up a PostgreSQL driver.

A few items to note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\family typewriter
name
\family default
 parameter for newConnection can be used if you need to have connections
 to multiple distinct databases.
 One specialized case of this is when you're doing DB sharding (horizontal
 scaling).
 Multiple database usage is covered in more depth in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Multiple-Databases"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The newConnection method needs to return a 
\family typewriter
Box[java.sql.Connection]
\family default
.
 Returning 
\family typewriter
Empty
\family default
 indicates failure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The releaseConnection method exists so that you have complete control over
 the lifecycle of the connection.
 For instance, if you were doing connection pooling yourself you would return
 the connection to the available pool rather than closing it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\family typewriter
DB.defineConnectionManager
\family default
 call is what binds our manager into Mapper.
 Without it your manager will never get called
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Constructing a Mapper-enabled Class
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sub:Constructing-a-Mapper-enabled-class"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we've covered some basic background, we can start constructing
 some Mapper classes to get more familiar with the framework.
 We'll start with a simple example of a class for an expense transaction
 from our PocketChange application with the following fields:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Date
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Description: a string with a max length of 100 chars
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Amount: a decimal value with a precision of 16 digits and two decimal places
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A reference to the Account that owns the transaction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given these requirements we can declare our 
\family typewriter
Expense
\family default
 class as shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Entry-class-mapper"

\end_inset

.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  object dateOf extends MappedDateTime(this)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For comparison, the Record version is shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Entry-class-record"

\end_inset

.
 This example already shows some functionality that hasn't been ported over
 to Record from Mapper; among other things, the 
\family typewriter
IdPK
\family default
 trait, and foreign key fields (many to one mappings) are missing.
 The other minor differences are that the 
\family typewriter
getSingleton
\family default
 method has been renamed to 
\family typewriter
meta
\family default
, and the Field traits use different names under the Record framework (i.e.
 
\family typewriter
DateTimeField
\family default
 vs 
\family typewriter
MappedDateTime
\family default
).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, we've set 
\family typewriter
Expense
\family default
 to extend the 
\family typewriter
LongKeyedMapper
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
IdPK
\family default
 traits and we've added the fields required by our class.
 We would like to provide a primary key for our entity; while not strictly
 necessary, having a synthetic primary key often helps with CRUD operations.
 The 
\family typewriter
LongKeyedMapper
\family default
 trait accomplishes two objectives: it tells Lift that we want a primary
 key defined and that the key should be a long.
 This is basically a shortcut for using the 
\family typewriter
KeyedMapper[Long,Expense]
\family default

\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
KeyedMapper
\end_layout

\end_inset

 trait.
 When you use the 
\family typewriter
KeyedMapper
\family default
 trait you need to provide an implementation for the 
\family typewriter
primaryKeyField
\family default
 def, which must match the type of the 
\family typewriter
KeyedMapper
\family default
 trait and be a subtype of 
\family typewriter
IndexedField
\family default

\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
IndexedField
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The 
\family typewriter
IdPK
\family default
 trait handles the implementation, but note that 
\family typewriter
IdPK
\family default
 currently only supports 
\family typewriter
Long
\family default
 keys.
 Mapper supports both indexed 
\family typewriter
Longs
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Strings
\family default
, so if you want 
\family typewriter
Strings
\family default
 you'll need to explicitly use 
\family typewriter
KeyedMapper[String,...]
\family default
 and provide the field definition yourself.
 It's possible to use some other type for your primary key, but you'll need
 to roll your own (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Defining-Custom-Field-types-mapper"

\end_inset

).
 Technically 
\family typewriter
Int
\family default
 indexes are supported as well, but there is no corresponding trait for
 an 
\family typewriter
Int
\family default
 foreign key.
 That means that if you use an 
\family typewriter
Int
\family default
 for the primary key, you may not be able to add a relationship to another
 object (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Object-Relationships"

\end_inset

), unless you write your own.
 Record is a little more flexible in primary key selection because it uses,
 in effect, a marker trait (
\family typewriter
KeyField
\family default
) to indicate that a particular field is a key field.
 One thing to note is that in the Mapper framework, the table name
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
table name
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for your entity defaults to the name of the class (Expense, in our case).
 If you want to change this, then you just need to override the 
\family typewriter
dbTableName
\family default

\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
dbTableName
\end_layout

\end_inset

 def in your MetaMapper object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at these examples, you've probably noticed that the fields are defined
 as objects rather than instance members (vars).
 The basic reason for this is that the MetaMapper needs access to fields
 for its validation and form functionality; it is more difficult to cleanly
 define these properties in the MetaMapper if it had to access member vars
 on each instance since a MetaMapper instance is itself an object.
 Also note that 
\family typewriter
MappedDecimal
\family default
 is a custom field type
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The authors are working on adding this to the core library soon after Lift
 1.0
\end_layout

\end_inset

, which we'll cover in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Defining-Custom-Field-types-mapper"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to tie all of this together, we need to define a matching 
\family typewriter
LongKeyedMetaMapper
\family default

\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
KeyedMetaMapper
\end_layout

\end_inset

 object as the singleton for our entity, as shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:EntryMeta-object"

\end_inset

.
 The Meta object (whether MetaMapper or MetaRecord) is where you define
 most behavior that is common across all of your instances.
 In our examples, we've decided to name the meta object and instance class
 the same.
 We don't feel that this is unclear because the two together are what really
 define the ORM behavior for a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

type.

In this instance, we're simply defining the order of fields as they'll be
 displayed in XHTML

\end_layout

 and forms
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
form
\end_layout

\end_inset

 by overriding the 
\family typewriter
fieldOrder
\family default
 method.
 The default behavior is an empty list, which means no fields are involved
 in display or form generation.
 Generally, you will want to override 
\family typewriter
fieldOrder
\family default
 because this is not very useful.
 If you don't want a particular field to show up in forms or XHTML output,
 simply omit it from the fieldOrder
\begin_inset Index idx

fieldOrder

 list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because fields aren't actually instance members, operations on them are
 slightly different than with a regular var.
 The biggest difference is how we set fields: we use the apply method.
 In addition, field access can be chained so that you can set multiple field
 values in one statement, as shown in Listing

Object Relationships
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Object-Relationships"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often it's appropriate to have relationships between different entities.
 The archetypical example of this is the parent-child relationship.
 In SQL, a relationship can be defined with a foreign key that associates
 one table to another based on the primary key of the associated table.
 As we showed in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Entry-class-mapper"

\end_inset

, there is a corresponding 
\family typewriter
MappedForeignKey
\family default
 trait, with concrete implementations for Long and String foreign keys.
 Once we have this defined, accessing the object via the relationship is
 achieved by using the 
\family typewriter
obj
\family default
 method on the foreign key field.
 Note that the 
\family typewriter
obj
\family default
 method returns a 
\family typewriter
Box
\family default
, so you need to do some further processing with it before you can use it.
 With the foreign key functionality you can easily do one-to-many and many-to-on
e
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
many-to-one
\end_layout

\end_inset

 relationships (depending on where you put the foreign key).
 One-to-many
\begin_inset Index idx

\end_inset

 relationships can be achieved using helper methods on the

 We'll cover queries in a moment, but Listing

 An example would be if we wanted to have tags (categories) for our ledger
 entries and wanted to be able to have a given entry have multiple tags
 (e.g., you purchase a book for your mother's birthday, so it has the tags
 Gift, Mom, and Books).
 First we define the

To use the join entity, you'll need to create a new instance and set the
 appropriate foreign keys to point to the associated instances.
 As you can see, we've defined a convenience method on our

 To make the many-to-many

A similar field could be set up on the

 entity to point to entries.
 It's important to note a few items:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The only way to add new entries is to directly construct the ExpenseTag
 instances and save them (either directly or via a helper method).
 You can't make any modifications via the HasManyThrough trait
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Although the field is defined as a query, the field is actually lazy and
 only runs once.
 That means if you query it and then add some new ExpenseTag instances,
 they won't show up in the field contents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want a way to retrieve the joined results such that it pulls fresh
 from the database each time, you can instead define a helper join method

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we've defined our entity we probably want to use it in the real
 world to load and store data.
 There are several operations on 
\family typewriter
MetaMapper
\family default
 that we can use :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
create Creates a new instance of the entity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
save Saves an instance to the database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
delete Deletes the given entity instance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
count Returns the number of instances of the given entity.
 An optional query criteria list can be used to narrow the entities being
 counted
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
countByInsecureSQL Similar to count, except a raw SQL string can be used
 to perform the count.
 The count value is expected to be in the first column and row of the returned
 result set.
 An example would be
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
Expense.countByInsecureSQL(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

select count(amount) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
There are also quite a few methods available for retrieving instances from
 the database.
 Each of these methods comes in two varieties: one that uses the default
 database connection, and one that allows you to specify the connection
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Mapper ! multiple databases
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to use (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref

\end_inset

).
 The latter typically has 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

DB
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 appended to the method name.
 The query methods on 
\family typewriter
MetaMapper
\family default
 are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
findAll Retrieves a list of instances from the database.
 The method is overloaded to take an optional set of query criteria parameters;
 these will be covered in detail in their own section, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Querying-for-Entities"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
findAllByInsecureSQL Retrieves a list of instances based on a raw SQL query.
 The query needs to return columns for all mapped fields.
 Usually you can use the 
\family typewriter
BySQL
\family default
 QueryParameter to cover most of the same functionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
findAllByPreparedStatement Similar to 
\family typewriter
findAllByInsecureSQL
\family default
 except that prepared statements are used, which usually means that the
 driver will handle properly escaping arguments in the query string.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
findAllFields This allows you to do a normal query returning only certain
 fields from your Mapper instance.
 For example, if you only wanted the amount from the transaction table you
 would use this method.
 Note that any fields that aren't specified in the query will return their
 default value.
 Generally, this method is only useful for read access to data because saving
 any retrieved instances could overwrite real data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
findMap* These methods provide the same functionality as the non-Map methods,
 but take an extra function argument that transforms an entity into a 
\family typewriter
Box[T]
\family default
, where 
\family typewriter
T
\family default
 is an arbitrary type.
 An example would be getting a list of descriptions of our transactions:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
Expense.findMap(entry => Full(entry.description.is))
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
KeyedMapperClass
\family default
 adds the 
\family typewriter
find
\family default
 method, which can be used to locate a single entity based on its primary
 key.
 In general these operations will be supported in both Record and Mapper.
 However, because Record isn't coupled tightly to a JDBC backend some of
 the find methods may not be supported directly and there may be additional
 methods not available in Mapper for persistence.
 For this reason, this section will deal specifically with Mapper's persistence
 operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Creating an Instance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we have a 
\family typewriter

\family default
 object defined we can use it to create objects using the 
\family typewriter
create
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
create
\end_layout

\end_inset


\family default
 method.
 You generally don't want to use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

new
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operator because the framework has to set up internal data for the instance
 such as field owner, etc.
 This is important to remember, since nothing will prevent you from creating
 an instance manually: you may just get errors when you go to use the instance.
 The 
\family typewriter
join
\family default
 method in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Join-Entity"

\end_inset

 shows an example of create usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Saving an Instance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Saving an instance is as easy as calling the 
\family typewriter
save
\family default
 method on the instance you want to save.
 Optionally, you can call the 
\family typewriter
save
\family default
 method on the Meta object, passing in the instance you want to save.
 The 
\family typewriter
save
\family default
 method uses the the 
\family typewriter
saved_?
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
clean_?
\family default
 flags to determine whether an insert or update is required to persist the
 current state to the database, and returns a boolean to indicate whether
 the save was successful or not.
 The 
\family typewriter
join
\family default
 method in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Join-Entity"

\end_inset

 shows an example of 
\family typewriter

 usage.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Deleting an Instance
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Deleting-an-Instance"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several ways to delete instances.
 The simplest way is to call the 
\family typewriter
delete_!
\family default
 method on the instance you'd like to remove.
 An alternative is to call the 
\family typewriter
delete_!
\family default
 method on the Meta object, passing in the instance to delete.
 In either case, the 
\family typewriter
delete_!
\family default
 method returns a boolean indicating whether the delete was successful or
 not.
 Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Another approach to deleting entities is to use the 
\family typewriter
bulkDelete_!!
\family default
 method on 
\family typewriter

 This method allows you to specify query parameters to control which entities
 are deleted.
 We will cover query parameters in Section

There are a variety of methods on

 The simplest method is 
\family typewriter
findAll
\family default

\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 called with no parameters.
 The

bare
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
findAll
\family default
 returns a 
\family typewriter
List
\family default
 of all of the instances of a given entity loaded from the database.
 Note that each 
\family typewriter
findAll...

\family default
 method has a corresponding method that takes a database connection for
 sharding or multiple database usage (see sharding in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Multiple-Databases"

\end_inset

).
 Of course, for all but the smallest datasets, pulling the entire model
 to get one entity from the database is inefficient and slow.
 Instead, the 
\family typewriter
MetaMapper
\family default
 provides 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flag
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 objects to control the query.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to use fine-grained queries to select data is a fundamental
 feature of relational databases, and Mapper provides first-class support
 for constructing queries in a manner that is not only easy to use, but
 type-safe.
 This means that you can catch query errors at compile time instead of runtime.
 The basis for this functionality is the 
\family typewriter
QueryParam
\family default
 trait, which has several concrete implementations that are used to construct
 the actual query.
 The 
\family typewriter
QueryParam
\family default
 implementations can be broken up into two main groups:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Comparison - These are typically items that would go in the where clause
 of an SQL query.
 They are used to refine the set of instances that will be returned
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Control - These are items that control things like sort order and pagination
 of the results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although Mapper provides a large amount of the functionality in SQL, some
 features are not covered directly or at all.
 In some cases we can define helper methods to make querying easier, particularl
y for joins (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:helper-joins"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Comparison QueryParams
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest 
\family typewriter
QueryParam
\family default
 to refine your query is the 
\family typewriter
By
\family default

\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
By
\end_layout

\end_inset

 object and its related objects.
 
\family typewriter
By
\family default
 is used for a direct value comparison of a given field: essentially an
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in SQL.
 For instance, Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Plain Layout

val myEntries = Expense.findAll(By(Expense.account, myAccount.id))
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that our By criterion is comparing the 
\family typewriter
Expense.account
\family default
 field to the primary key (
\family typewriter
id
\family default
 field) of our account instead of to the account instance itself.
 This is because the 
\family typewriter
Expense.account
\family default
 field is a 
\family typewriter
MappedForeignKey
\family default
 field, which uses the type of the key instead of the type of the entity
 as its underlying value.
 In this instance, that means that any queries using 
\family typewriter
Expense.account
\family default
 need to use a 
\family typewriter
Long
\family default
 to match the underlying type.

\begin_layout Standard
Here things are starting to get a little hairy.
 The 
\family typewriter
InRaw
\family default
 only allows us to specify the subquery for the IN clause, so we have to
 do some postprocessing to get unique results.
 If you want to do this in the query itself you'll have to use the 
\family typewriter
findAllByInsecureSql
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
findAllByPreparedStatement
\family default
 methods, which are covered later in this section on page number 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "sub:SQL-based-queries"

\end_inset

.
 The final parameter for 
\family typewriter
InRaw
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
IHaveValidatedThisSQL
\family default
 acts as a code audit mechanism that says that someone has checked the SQL
 to make sure it's safe to use.
 The query fragment is added to the master query as-is: no escaping or other
 filtering is performed on the string.
 That means that if you take user input.
 then you need to be very careful about it or you run the risk of an SQL
 injection attack on your site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next 
\family typewriter
QueryParam
\family default
 we'll cover is 
\family typewriter
BySql
\family default
, which lets you use a complete SQL fragment that gets put into the where
 clause.
 An example of this would be if we want to find all expense entries within
 the last 30 days, as shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Using-BySql"

 supports parameterized queries as shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

As we mentioned in Section

 Simply use the

 Obviously, the control params that we'll cover next make no sense in this

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we've covered the selection and comparison 
\family typewriter
QueryParams
\family default
, we can start to look at the control params.
 The first one that we'll look at is 
\family typewriter
OrderBy
\family default
.
 This operates exactly like the order by clause in SQL, and allows you to
 sort on a given field in either ascending or descending order.
 Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:OrderBy-Clause"

\end_inset

 shows an example of ordering our 
\family typewriter
Expense
\family default
 entries by amount.
 The 
\family typewriter
Ascending
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Descending
\family default
 case objects are in the net.liftweb.mapper package.
 The 
\family typewriter
OrderBySql
\family default
 case class operates similarly, except that you provide your own SQL fragment
 for the ordering, as shown in the example.
 Again, you need to validate this SQL.

Pagination of results is another feature that people often want to use,
 and Mapper provides a simple means for controlling it with two more 
\family typewriter
QueryParam
\family default
 classes: 
\family typewriter
StartAt
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
MaxRows
\family default
, as shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Pagination-of-Results"

\end_inset

 In this example, we take the offset from a parameter passed to our snippet,
 with a default of zero.

An important feature of the methods that take 
\family typewriter

\family default
 is that they can take multiple params, as shown in this example.
 A more complex example is shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Multiple-QueryParams"

.
 In this example, we're querying with a 
\family typewriter

 all in one statement!

\begin_layout Standard
Another useful 
\family typewriter
QueryParam
\family default
 is the 
\family typewriter
Distinct
\family default
 case class, which acts exactly the same way as the DISTINCT keyword in
 SQL.
 One caveat is that Mapper doesn't support explicit joins, so this restricts
 the situations in which you can use 
\family typewriter
Distinct
\family default
.
 The final 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

control

\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
QueryParam
\family default
 that we'll cover is 
\family typewriter
PreCache
\family default

\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
PreCache
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It's used when you have a mapped foreign key field on an entity.
 Normally, when Mapper loads your main entity it leaves the foreign key
 field in a lazy state, so that the query to get the foreign object isn't
 executed until you access the field.
 This can obviously be inefficient when you have many entities loaded that
 you need to access, so the 
\family typewriter
PreCache
\family default
 parameter forces Mapper to preload the foreign objects as part of the query.
 Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Using-PreCache"

\end_inset

 shows how we can use 
\family typewriter
PreCache

Making Joins a Little Friendlier

\begin_layout Standard
If you prefer to keep your queries type-safe, but you want a little more

 One example is finding all of the tags for a given 
\family typewriter
Expense
\family default

 Using this method in our example has an advantage over using 
\family typewriter
HasManyThrough
\family default
: 
\family typewriter
hasManyThrough
\family default
 is a lazy value that will only retrieve data from the database once per
 request.
 Using a 
\family typewriter

 will retrieve data from the database every time.
 This may be important if you add data to the database during a request,
 or if you expect things to change between queries.

\begin_layout Subsection
Display Generation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to display a Mapper instance as XHTML, simply call the 
\family typewriter
asHtml
\family default
 method (
\family typewriter
toXHtml
\family default
 in Record) on your instance.
 The default implementation turns each field's value into a 
\family typewriter
Text
\family default
 node via the 
\family typewriter
toString
\family default
 method and concatenates the results separated by newlines.
 If you want to change this behavior, override the 
\family typewriter
asHtml
\family default
 on your field definitions.
 For example, if we wanted to control formatting on our 
\family typewriter
dateOf
\family default
 field, we could modify the field as shown in Listing

LatexCommand ref

 Two similar methods,

 The

\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset


\family default
 method on Mapper is overloaded so that you can control how your form is
 created.
 All three 
\family typewriter
toForm
\family default
 methods on Mapper take a 
\family typewriter
Box[String]
\family default
 as their first parameter to control the submit button; if the Box is Empty,
 no submit button is generated, otherwise, the String contents of the Box
 are used as the button label.
 If you opt to skip the submit button you'll need to provide it yourself
 via binding or some other mechanism, or you can rely on implicit form submissio
n (when the user hits enter in a text field, for instance).
 The first 
\family typewriter
toForm
\family default
 method simply takes a function to process the submitted form and returns
 the XHTML as shown in Listing

 The second

 validation succeeds on form submission (this is not provided in Record).
 This can be used for something like a login form, as shown in Listing

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Validation
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Validation is the process of checking a field during form processing to
 make sure that the submitted value meets requirements.
 This can be something as simple as ensuring that a value was submitted,
 or as complex as comparing multiple field values together.
 Validation is achieved via a 
\family typewriter
List
\family default
 of functions on a field that take the field value as input and return a
 
\family typewriter
List[FieldError]
\family default
 (
\family typewriter
Box[Node]
\family default
 in Record).
 To indicate that validation succeeded, simply return an empty List, otherwise
 the list of 
\family typewriter
FieldErrors
\family default
 you return are used as the failure messages to be presented to the user.
 A 
\family typewriter
FieldError
\family default
 is simply a case class that associates an error message with a particular
 field.
 As an example, let's say we don't want someone to be able to add an 
\family typewriter
Expense
\family default
 entry for a date in the future.
 First, we need to define a function for our 
\family typewriter
dateOf
\family default
 field that takes a 
\family typewriter
Date
\family default
 as an input (For Record, 
\family typewriter
java.util.Calendar
\family default

\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Calendar
\end_layout

\end_inset

, not 
\family typewriter
Date
\family default
, is the actual value type of 
\family typewriter
DateTimeField
\family default
) and returns the proper 
\family typewriter
List
\family default
.
 We show a simple function in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Date-validation"

\end_inset

.
 In the method, we simply check to see if the millisecond count is greater
 than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and return an error message if so.

The next step is to tie the validation into the field itself.
 We do this by slightly modifying our field definition for

\family default

reference "lst:Setting-validators"

\end_inset

\begin_layout Plain Layout

// Using the alternate definition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

object dateOf extends MappedDateTime(this) {

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  override def validations = ValidationMethods.noFutureDates(dateOf) _ ::
 Nil
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that we need to add the underscore for each validation function to
 be partially applied on the submitted value.
 When our form is submitted, all of the validators for each field are run,
 and if all of them return Empty then validation succeeds.
 If any validators return a Full Box, then the contents of the Box are displayed
 as error messages to the user.

\begin_layout Subsection
CRUD Support
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adding CRUD support to your Mapper classes is very simple.
 We just mix in the 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset

net.liftweb.mapper.CRUDify
\family default
 trait to our meta object and it provides a full set of add, edit, list,
 delete and view pages automatically.
 Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Mixing-in-CRUDify"

\end_inset

 shows our 
\family typewriter
Expense
\family default
 meta object with 
\family typewriter
CRUDify
\family default
 mixed in.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  override def deleteMenuLoc = Empty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CRUDify behavior is very flexible, and you can control the templates
 for pages or whether pages are shown at all (as we do in our example) by
 overriding defs that are provided on the CRUDify trait.
 In our example Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Mixing-in-CRUDify"

\end_inset

, we disable the delete menu by overriding the
\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
deleteMenuLoc
\family default
 method to return 
\family typewriter
Empty
\family default
.
 As an added bonus, CRUDify automatically creates a set of menus for SiteMap
 (Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cha:SiteMap"

\end_inset

) that we can use by appending them onto the rest of our menus as shown
 in Listing

\begin_layout Subsection
Lifecycle Callbacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mapper and Record provide for a set of callbacks that allow you to perform
 actions at various points during the lifecycle of a given instance.
 If you want to define your own handling for one of the lifecycle events,
 all you need to do is override and define the callback because 
\family typewriter
MetaMapper
\family default
 already extends the 
\family typewriter
LifecycleCallbacks
\family default
 trait.
 Note that there is a separate 
\family typewriter
LifecycleCallbacks
\family default
 trait in each of the record and mapper packages, so make sure that you
 import the correct one.
 For example, if we want to notify a Comet actor whenever a new 
\family typewriter
Expense
\family default
 entry is saved, we can change our 
\family typewriter
Expense
\family default
 class as shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

The first part of the class definition is the type signature; basically
 the type 
\family typewriter
[T <: MappedField[T]]
\family default
 indicates that whatever type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

owns
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 this field must be a Mapper subclass (<: specifies an upper type bound

\end_inset

).
 With our primary constructor we specify the owner mapper as well as the
 
\family typewriter
MathContext
\family default
 (this controls rounding and precision, or the total number of digits) and
 scale of the decimal value.
 The scale in 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
 essentially represents the number of digits to the right of the decimal
 point.
 In addition, we specify ancillary constructors to take an initial value
 with or without and explicit 
\family typewriter
MathContext
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we have the constructors in place, there are several abstract methods
 on 
\family typewriter
MappedField
\family default
 that we need to define.
 The first of these is a method to provide a default value.
 The default value is used for uninitialized fields or if validation fails.
 We also need to specify the class for our value type by implementing the
 
\family typewriter
dbFieldClass
\family default
 method.
 Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Setting-a-default-value"

\end_inset

 shows both of these methods.
 In our case, we default to a zero value, with the scale set as specified
 in the contructor.
 Note that 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
 instances are generally immutable, so the 
\family typewriter
setScale
\family default
 method returns a new instance.
 We also provide the vars and methods that handle the before and after values
 of the field.
 These values are used to handle persistence state.
 If you change the value of the field, then the original value is held until
 the instance is saved to the database.
 The 
\family typewriter
st
\family default
 method is used internally to set the value of the field when instances
 are

rehydrated
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\family default
 methods.
 The

 method returns the a value that is used when the user doesn't have read
 permissions.
 The

 when the field is updated.

The next two methods that we need to provide deal with actually setting
 the value of the field.
 The first is 
\family typewriter
setFromAny
\family default
, which takes an 
\family typewriter
Any
\family default
 parameter and must convert it into a 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
.
 The second, 
\family typewriter
setFromString
\family default
 is a subset of 
\family typewriter
setFromAny
\family default
 in that it takes a 
\family typewriter
String
\family default
 parameter and must return a 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
.
 Our implementation of these two methods is shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:setFrom...-Methods"

\end_inset

.
 We've also added a 
\family typewriter
setAll
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
coerce
\family default
 method so that we have a common place to properly set scale and rounding
 modes on the value of the field.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our implementations are relatively straightforward.
 The only special handling we need for 
\family typewriter
setFromAny
\family default
 is to properly deal with 
\family typewriter
Lists
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
Boxes
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
Options
\family default
 and the 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 value.
 The 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
 constructor takes Strings, so the 
\family typewriter
setFromString
\family default
 method is easy.
 The only addition we make over the 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
 constructor is to properly set the scale and rounding on the returned value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our final step is to define the database-specific methods for our field,

.
 The first method we implement is 
\family typewriter
targetSQLType
\family default
.
 This method tells Mapper what the corresponding SQL type is for our database
 column.
 The 
\family typewriter
jdbcFriendly
\family default
 method returns a value that can be used in a JDBC statement.
 Here's where we need to use the 
\family typewriter
bigDecimal
\family default
 val on our 
\family typewriter
scala.BigDecimal
\family default
 to obtain the real 
\family typewriter
java.math.BigDecimal
\family default
 instance.
 Similarly, the 
\family typewriter
real_convertToJDBCFriendly
\family default
 method needs to return a java 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
 for a given 
\family typewriter
scala.BigDecimal
\family default
 input.
 The 
\family typewriter
buildSet...

\family default
 methods return functions that can be used to set the value of our field
 based on different input types.
 These are essentially conversion functions that are used by Lift to convert
 data retrieved in a 
\family typewriter
ResultSet
\family default
 into actual field values.
 Finally, the 
\family typewriter
fieldCreatorString
\family default
 specifices what we would need in a CREATE TABLE statement to define this
 column.
 In this instance, we need to take into account the precision and scale.
 We use default precision if we're set to unlimited, but it's important
 to understand that actual precision for the default DECIMAL type varies
 between RDBMS vendors.

In addition to all of the database-related features, Mapper contains an
 extra goody to help you quickly set up small sites.
 
\family typewriter
ProtoUser
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
MegaProtoUser
\family default
 are two built-in traits that define a simple user account.
 The 
\family typewriter
ProtoUser
\family default
 trait defines some basic fields for a user: 
\family typewriter
email
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
firstName
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
lastName
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
password
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
superUser
\family default
 (a boolean to provide basic permissions).
 There are also a number of defs used to format the fields for display or
 to provide form labels.

It's common for an application to need to access data in more than one database.
 Lift supports this feature through the use of overrides on your MetaMapper
 classes.
 First, we need to define the identifiers for the various databases using
 the 
\family typewriter
ConnectionIdentifier
\family default
 trait and overriding the 
\family typewriter
jndiName
\family default
 def.
 Lift comes with one pre-made: 
\family typewriter
DefaultConnectionIdentifier
\family default
.
 It's jndiName is set to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, so it's recommended that you use something else.
 Let's say we have two databases: sales and employees.
 Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\family typewriter
ConnectionIdentifier
\family default
 objects for these.

Now that we've defined our connection identifiers, we need to be able to
 use them in our 
\family typewriter
Mapper
\family default
 instances.
 There are several ways to do this.
 The first (simplest) way is to override the 
\family typewriter
dbDefaultConnectionIdentifier
\family default
 method on your 
\family typewriter
MetaMapper
\family default
 object, as shown in Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Defining-the-Default-connid"

\end_inset

.
 In this example we're setting the 
\family typewriter
MetaMapper
\family default
 to always use the 
\family typewriter
EmployeeDB
\family default
 connection for all persistence operations.

.
 Sharding is a means to scale your database capacity by associating entities
 with one database instance out of a federation of servers based on some
 property of the entity.
 For instance, we could distribute user entites across 3 database servers
 by using the first character of the last name: A-H goes to server 1, I-P
 goes to server 2, and Q-Z goes to server 3.
 As simple as this sounds, there are some important factors to remember:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sharding increases the complexity of your code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To get the most benefit out of sharding, you need to carefully choose and
 tune your 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

selector.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 If you're not careful, you can get an uneven distribution where some servers
 handle significantly more load than others, defeating the purpose of sharding.
 The example we've given here of using the last name is, in practice, a
 very poor choice.
 We recommend reading 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/2009/01/sharding-for-startups.html"

\end_inset

 for a good overview of the pros and cons of various selector strategies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When you use sharding, you can't just use normal joins anymore because the
 data isn't all within one instance.
 This means more work on your part to properly retrieve and associate data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mapper provides a handy feature 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Or does it? Confirm whether or not this is supported.
\end_layout

\end_inset

for sharding that allows you to choose which database connection you want
 to use for a specific entity.
 There are two methods we can use to control the behavior: 
\family typewriter
dbSelectDBConnectionForFind
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
dbCalculateConnectionIdentifier
\family default
.
 dbSelect...
 is used to find an instance by primary key, and takes a partial function
 (typically a match clause) to determine which connection to use.
 dbCalculate...
 is used when a new instance is created to decide where to store the new
 instance.
 As an example, say we've defined two database connections, SalesA and SalesB.
 We want to place new instances in SalesA if the amount is > $100 and SalesB
 otherwise.

 The

The

 statement without any checks.
 The same general rules apply as for
\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
findAllByPreparedStatement
\family default
, although you need to add the 
\family typewriter
IHaveValidatedThisSQL
\family default
 parameter as a code audit check.
 In either case, the ability to use full SQL queries can allow you to do
 some very powerful things, but it comes at the cost of losing type safety
 and possibly making your app non-portable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a last resort, Mapper provides support for non-entity SQL queries through
 a few methods on the DB object.
 The first method we'll look at is 
\family typewriter
DB.runQuery
\family default
.
 This method allows you to provide a full SQL query string, and is overloaded
 to take a parameterized query.
 It returns a 
\family typewriter
Pair[List[String],List[List[String]]
\family default
, with the first 
\family typewriter
List[String]
\family default
 containing all of the column names and the second 
\family typewriter
List
\family default
 corresponding to each row in the result set.
 For example, let's say we wanted to compute the sums of each tag for a
 given account.

If you need full control over the query and full access to the result set,
 DB provides some low-level utility methods.
 The most basic is 
\family typewriter
DB.use
\family default
, which takes a connection identifier as well as a function that takes a
 
\family typewriter
SuperConnection
\family default
 (a thin wrapper on JDBC's connection).
 This forms a loan pattern

 that lets Mapper deal with all of the connection open and release details.
 The 
\family typewriter
DB.exec
\family default
 method takes a provided connection and executes an arbitrary SQL statement
 on it, then applies a provided function to the result set.
 Similarly, the 
\family typewriter
DB.prepareStatement
\family default
 method allows you to create a prepared statement and then apply a function
 to it.
 You can combine these methods to run any arbitrary SQL, as shown in Listing

Summary 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, we discussed the two major ORMs included in Lift: Mapper
 and Record.
 We’ve shown how you can define entities using the Mapper field types and
 how to coordinate between the entity and its Meta-object.
 We’ve shown how you can customize the display and schema of your behavior
 with custom form control, CRUD support, and indexing.
 And we've show you how to query for entities using Mapper’s type-safe query
 support.
 Finally, we showed you how you can do in-depth customization of Mapper
 behavior by writing your own field types, using multiple databases, and
 using raw SQL queries.
